## Code Conventions

We recommend using [official go code conventions](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

## Project Layout

We follow the layout [Standard Go Project Layout
](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for Go application projects.

It's not an official standard defined by the core Go dev team; however, it is a set of common historical and emerging project layout patterns in the Go ecosystem.

Some of these patterns are more popular than others. It also has a number of small enhancements along with several supporting directories common to any large enough real world application.
